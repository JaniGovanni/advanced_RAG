      "expected_answer": "The `run_target` method does the following:\n1. Updates the observers by calling `self.observers()`.\n2. Calls `pre_observe_first_all` on the differential observers for the primary executor.\n3. Calls `pre_exec_all` on the primary observers.\n4. Runs the primary executor's `run_target` method.\n5. Calls `post_exec_all` on the primary observers.\n6. Calls `post_observe_first_all` on the differential observers for the primary executor.\n7. Calls `pre_observe_second_all` on the differential observers for the secondary executor.\n8. Calls `pre_exec_all` on the secondary observers.\n9. Runs the secondary executor's `run_target` method.\n10. Calls `post_exec_all` on the secondary observers.\n11. Calls `post_observe_second_all` on the differential observers for the secondary executor.\n12. Compares the exit kinds of the primary and secondary executors. If they are the same, returns the exit kind. If they are different, returns an `ExitKind::Diff` containing both exit kinds.",
      "given_answer": "The `run_target` method of the `DiffExecutor` calls the `post_exec` method with the current state, input, and exit kind. It also runs the secondary executor in addition to the primary executor. The method returns a result containing an `ExitKind` or an `Error`.",

SIGNALS is an array of 64 bytes initialized to 0, and SIGNALS_PTR is a mutable pointer to the SIGNALS array. The signals_set function is used to assign a signal to the signals map at a specific index.",

      "query": "How does the harness closure work?",
      "expected_answer": "The harness closure takes a BytesInput and compares its target_bytes() against a goal byte slice. It iterates over the input and goal bytes using zip and take_while, setting signals in the SIGNALS map using signals_set for each matching byte. If the entire goal is matched, it either panics (on Unix) or writes 0 to a null pointer (on Windows) to trigger an artificial bug. Finally, it returns ExitKind::Ok.",
      "given_answer": "The harness closure works by iterating over the input bytes and a predefined goal string in parallel, checking if the bytes match the goal string. It keeps track of the number of matching bytes and if all bytes match, it triggers an artificial bug on Unix systems or performs a specific action on Windows.",

      "expected_answer": "The fuzzer uses two feedbacks: MaxMapFeedback and CrashFeedback. MaxMapFeedback is used to rate the interestingness of an input based on the coverage observed by the StdMapObserver. CrashFeedback is used to determine if an input is a solution (i.e., triggers a crash).",

StringIdentificationStage is used to identify string categories and subcategories in the input, which can then be used by the mutators. StdMutationalStage is a transforming stage that applies the scheduled mutators to generate new inputs.",

      "given_answer": "The `OomObserver` struct detects if the target would run out of memory or otherwise violate the permissible usage of malloc. It tracks the target's memory usage and checks for out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. It also resets the OOM tracking state before each execution.",
